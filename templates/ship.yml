#general rule for item references: take its ingame name, make it all lowercase, replace spaces with dashes
#example: for blueprints, Shroud Blueprint => shroud-blueprint
 
#list of recipes this item is relevant in. Recipes may be for what makes the item, or what the item is used for. 
#for example, metal scraps is used to make multiple things, so the scrapping recipe is in metal-scraps.yml, and not in korrelite.yml or any other resource.yml

#recipe input types:
# item, ship, cargo
# if quantity is less than 1, it is interpreted as a chance, like 0.9 is 90% chance (used in metal scrap recipe)
